## Layout and Component Guidance
Home
- Hero card for Today with strong title + exercise chips.
- Primary CTA with accent fill, secondary CTA with outlined surface.
- Music and content links as pills/chips, not plain text.

Plan
- Today card is prominent and visually distinct.
- Weekly cards are slim, tight spacing, and use accent to highlight focus.

Library
- Exercise cards with image left, text right, strong title.
- Detail modal should feel like a glass panel (dark surface + border).

FormCoach
- Rep count large and centered.
- Cues in a compact list; emphasize most important cue.
- Overlay should feel like a HUD panel with glassy backdrop.

Onboarding
- Use pill buttons for choices with clear active state.
- Keep flow fast, 1-2 lines per section.

## Motion
- Subtle fade + slide on screen load.
- Staggered list reveals on Library and Plan.
- CTA press feedback (scale down 0.98) for tactile feel.

## Engineering Notes and Performance
- MediaPipe in WebView is heavy; keep modelComplexity low and throttle messages.
- Use requestAnimationFrame in pose loop if needed to reduce jitter.
- Keep WebView messaging payload small (exercise, repCount, cues only).
- Consider reducing overlay re-renders by memoizing cues UI.
- Use FlatList for library (already done) and ensure keyExtractor is stable.

## Code and Architecture Enhancements
- Use SafeAreaView or padding for top/bottom to avoid notch overlap.
- Add typed navigation params for safer navigation.
- Extract shared styles and spacing constants to theme.
- Add basic error handling for AsyncStorage reads/writes.
- Add a small skeleton/loading state when plan is not ready.
- Add offline fallback for MediaPipe by bundling scripts locally.

## UX Improvements (optional)
- Add a short onboarding success screen after plan creation.
- Add a lightweight weekly progress indicator (dots or streak).
- Offer an exercise switcher on FormCoach (squat/push-up) in RN UI.

## Known Constraints
- WebView uses CDN scripts and needs network access.
- Accuracy of form cues is MVP-level only.
- External image URLs depend on network.
