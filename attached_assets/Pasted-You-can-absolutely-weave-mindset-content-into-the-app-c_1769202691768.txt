You can absolutely weave “mindset” content into the app **cleanly**—and you can do it in a way that’s **low-risk for licensing** if you stick to **Public Domain / CC0** sources and keep attribution metadata.

## How to integrate quotes + graphics without ruining the minimalist vibe

### Where it fits in the app (minimal, not cringe)

1. **Home header (Daily Focus)**
   One short quote + author, tappable to expand.
2. **Pre-workout “Focus card” (10 seconds)**
   “Breathe. Brace. Control.” + a simple motif (dot-grid, ring, bar).
3. **Post-workout “Reflection”**
   1 line: “You showed up today.” + optional longer quote.
4. **Share card (optional)**
   Generate a clean black/white poster image to share (no feed, no doomscroll).

### Visual motifs that match your black/white style

* **Duotone portraits** (pure black silhouette + soft grain)
* **Progress ring** as a design “signature”
* **3-word mantras** (“Slow. Strong. Stable.”) as section titles
* Subtle **halftone / film grain** background to avoid “empty white”

## Licensing: the lowest-hassle sources

### Safest “no drama” rule

Use only:

* **Public Domain** portraits / text
* **CC0** images

This avoids ShareAlike obligations and complicated attribution chains.

### Great sources

1. **Smithsonian Open Access (CC0)** – millions of items you can use freely, no permission required. ([Smithsonian Institution][1])
2. **Wikimedia Commons** – lots of portraits are Public Domain or free licenses (but you must check each file’s license). ([Wikimedia Commons][2])
3. **Openverse** – search and filter by license (including `cc0` and `pdm`). ([openverse.org][3])

### What to avoid for “no hassle”

* **Wikiquote text as your quote database**: Wikiquote content is **CC BY-SA** (ShareAlike), which can be annoying for apps (you’d need attribution + sharealike compliance for derived content). ([Wikiquote][4])
  If you *do* use it, it’s doable—just not “lowest hassle.”

## Important: quote accuracy (your Emerson example)

That “purpose of life is not to be happy…” line is **commonly misattributed** (often traced to Leo Rosten variants). Wikiquote and Quote Investigator both flag this. ([Wikiquote][5])
So: either use verified quotes, or label as **“Attributed”**.

## A clean implementation plan (practical)

### 1) Store a tiny curated “Mindset Pack” locally

Create a JSON file like:

```json
{
  "id": "emerson-001",
  "text": "…",
  "author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson",
  "attribution": "Public Domain / Verified source",
  "image": "emerson_portrait_cc0.jpg",
  "imageLicense": "CC0",
  "imageSource": "Smithsonian Open Access",
  "sourceUrl": "..."
}
```

Even if CC0 doesn’t require attribution, keeping this metadata makes your life easier.

### 2) Convert portraits into your exact black/white style

Take a CC0/PD portrait and run a simple processing step (on-device or build-time):

* grayscale → increase contrast → posterize → add grain → optional vignette
  This makes mixed-source images look like a single coherent brand.

### 3) Generate “quote posters” on the fly

In React Native/Expo you can render a “QuoteCard” view and export it as an image for sharing (later). For MVP, just show the card.

### 4) Add a “Credits & Licenses” screen

One screen listing:

* image title, author/creator (if provided)
* license (CC0/PD)
* source link
  This keeps you clean if you ever include anything that isn’t CC0.

## If you want: I can give you a Codex prompt

Tell me whether you want:

* **Local pack only** (fastest, no network), or
* **Openverse API fetch** filtered to `cc0`/`pdm` (more scalable but network + caching)

…and I’ll write a single pasteable Codex instruction that generates:

* `mindsetQuotes.json`
* `QuoteCard.tsx` (your black/white layout)
* `DailyFocus` hook (rotates quote daily)
* `CreditsScreen.tsx` populated from metadata
