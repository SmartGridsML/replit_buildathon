# FitForm (Buildathon) - Agent Brief

## Purpose + Ethos
FitForm is a focused MVP that solves one high-value problem: real-time exercise form coaching with a weekly plan. It is not a Hevy clone. The product centers on fast, actionable feedback so users can move safely and build consistency.

Key principles:
- Solve one problem deeply (form + plan), not many shallow features.
- Keep everything local and lightweight (no backend for MVP).
- Design should feel modern, sport-tech, and confident.

## Core Features (MVP)
1) Onboarding
- Collects: goal, equipment, experience, injuries.
- Generates and stores a weekly plan locally.

2) Weekly Plan Generator
- Inputs: goal, equipment, experience, injuries.
- Outputs: 3 or 5 workouts per week (based on experience).
- Injury swaps replace risky exercises with safer alternatives.
- Stored locally (AsyncStorage).

3) Exercise Library
- 10-20 curated exercises with name, description, and image URL.
- Tap to view a detail modal.

4) FormCoach (Pose WebView)
- WebView loads `assets/pose.html`.
- Uses MediaPipe Pose to detect squat or push-up.
- Simple rep counting + cues.
- Sends JSON to React Native:
  {
    "exercise": "squat",
    "repCount": 5,
    "cues": ["Keep knees over toes", "Hips back"]
  }

5) Content + Music Links
- Spotify playlist deep links with fallback to web URL.
- Curated YouTube/TikTok links.

## User Flow
1) Launch app
2) Onboarding questions
3) Plan is generated and stored
4) Home shows today's workout + links
5) User can open:
   - Plan screen to see weekly plan / regenerate
   - Library screen to browse exercises
   - FormCoach to get live form cues

## Screen Map
- Onboarding
- Home (Today + links)
- Plan (Today + weekly list)
- Library (list + modal detail)
- FormCoach (camera + rep/cue overlay)

## Design System (Sport-Tech)
- Dark graphite base with neon mint accent.
- High contrast, glassy cards, subtle glow elements.
- Bold, condensed headers; clean body text.
- Visual direction: premium performance tech.

Files:
- Theme tokens: `theme.ts`
- Background treatment: `components/ScreenBackground.tsx`

## Technical Notes
- Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81.5, React 19.1.0.
- WebView uses local `pose.html` with MediaPipe CDN scripts.
- Requires camera permissions (iOS/Android configured in `app.json`).
- Storage: AsyncStorage (local only).

## Known Constraints
- Pose uses CDN scripts (requires network).
- Rep logic is minimal for MVP (not clinically accurate).
- Exercise images are external URLs.

## Recommended Next Steps (optional)
- Add offline MediaPipe bundling.
- Add animated intro/CTA micro-motion.
- Expand exercise library + add tags/filters.
- Improve form logic for more accuracy.

## Run Commands
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Start: `npx expo start`
- Web: `npx expo start --web`
