# FitForm - Comprehensive Mobile App Build Guide

This document outlines end-to-end steps to build a full fitness mobile app, aligned to modern fitness app best practices and AI coaching trends. It also includes a gap analysis of the current repo against this checklist.

## 1) Vision, Problem, and Success Metrics
- Define the core user problem (ex: learn safe form + stay consistent).
- Define primary metrics: weekly active users, workout completions, retention, and goal success rate.
- Identify the sharp differentiation: real-time form coaching + adaptive plans.

## 2) Market and User Research
- Identify target users (beginners, returning athletes, rehab, home vs gym).
- Audit competitors and note gaps (form feedback, adaptive programming, simplicity).
- Validate interest with a quick landing page or interview script.

## 3) Product Strategy and Core Loop
- Core loop: Onboard -> plan -> workout -> feedback -> reward -> repeat.
- Keep MVP narrow and valuable. Defer advanced logging and social features.
- Define V1 vs V2: V1 adds coaching accuracy and habit formation, V2 adds social and analytics.

## 4) Feature Scope (Comprehensive App)
MVP features:
- Onboarding: goals, equipment, injuries, experience
- Weekly plan generator
- Exercise library with descriptions and media
- Form coaching (camera + cues)
- Basic workout session flow

V1 features:
- Progress tracking (streaks, weekly completion)
- Gamification (XP, levels, achievements)
- Learn section for injury prevention and training basics
- Music and content links

V2+ features:
- Cloud sync + account login
- Personalized adaptations (predictive workouts)
- Community and coaching programs
- Payments and subscriptions

## 5) IA and User Flows
- App structure: Onboarding -> Tab navigation
- Tabs: Home, Plan, Library, Learn, Coach
- Workout flow: Start -> Timer + cues -> Complete -> Reward
- Form coach flow: Select exercise -> Camera -> cues -> reps

## 6) Design System and UX Standards
- Brand: minimal white/black, high contrast, clean typography
- Components: pill buttons, cards, chips, progress bars
- Motion: subtle fade + slide on screen load, pressed scale on CTAs
- Accessibility: contrast, readable type sizes, and labeled touch targets

## 7) Data Model and Storage
Core entities:
- UserProfile, WeeklyPlan, Workout, Exercise
- UserStats (XP, streaks, achievements)
- WorkoutSession (completedAt, exerciseCount)
- LearnTopic and ReadStatus

Storage:
- Local storage for MVP (AsyncStorage)
- Cloud sync for V2 (auth + user data + analytics)

## 8) Architecture and Tech
- Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- React Navigation (stack + tabs)
- WebView or native vision SDK for form coaching
- Modular data layer with tests for plan generation and gamification

## 9) AI Coaching and Adaptation
- Pose estimation on device for key lifts
- Rep detection and form cues
- Predictive plans based on adherence, recovery, and injury risk
- Lightweight messages to the UI (exercise, reps, cues)

## 10) Content Pipeline
- Exercise library with images and descriptions
- Educational topics (injuries, muscles, recovery, nutrition)
- Optional: content CMS for scale later

## 11) QA and Reliability
- Unit tests for plan logic and gamification
- Manual QA script for camera, onboarding, and workout session
- Crash monitoring and performance tracking

## 12) Launch and Growth
- Soft launch with feedback loop
- Track retention, drop-off, and session completion
- Iterate on top friction points

# Current Repo Gap Analysis vs This Checklist

## Implemented
- Onboarding (name, goal, equipment, experience, injuries)
- Weekly plan generator + regeneration
- Exercise library with filters and detail modal
- Learn section with educational content
- Gamification system (XP, levels, achievements)
- Workout session timer + completion flow
- Progress tracking on Home
- Tests for plan generation and gamification

## Partial
- Form coaching: current screen is static tips, not camera-based form feedback.
- Content links: Spotify/YouTube links are not present in the current Home UI.
- UI consistency: most screens are white/black, but the Library modal is dark.

## Missing (from comprehensive scope)
- Real-time form coaching via camera/WebView or native vision SDK
- App icon, splash screen assets, and actual favicon in assets
- Cloud sync and authentication
- Analytics and crash reporting
- Push notifications / reminders
- Adjustable workout parameters (sets, reps, rest) or logged history
- Offline media assets or bundled content
- Admin or content pipeline for exercise media

# Suggested Priority Fixes
1) Restore camera-based Form Coach (WebView + MediaPipe or native SDK).
2) Add app icon + splash assets.
3) Add music/content links on Home.
4) Add basic analytics event tracking.
